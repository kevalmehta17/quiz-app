# ðŸ“š React Quiz App ðŸ“š

This React-based quiz application demonstrates the use of the `useReducer` hook for state management. Unlike traditional approaches using `useState`, this app relies solely on `useReducer` to handle state changes. It also utilizes `useEffect` to manage timing for the quiz. Users can take a quiz with a time limit, and their results are displayed at the end.

## Features

- **State Management with `useReducer`**: Manages quiz state without `useState`.
- **Timer**: Limits the quiz to a specific duration.
- **Results Display**: Shows the user's score and correct answers after completion.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes.
